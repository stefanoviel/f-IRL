run halfchetaah with mlIRL
is it fine that the reward is only on the states? you need to do both for state action
script to extract rewards from row data


why do you want do make comparison between different ones? 
halfcethaa hyperparasm are the same... start ml-ir


is there a way to not choose the clipping value manually?
